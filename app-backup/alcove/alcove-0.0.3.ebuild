# I am quite certain this system will be stable on most any platforms
# that have a stable NodeJS install, but as I have no capacity to test
# this, we will limit the list to those systems I have installed on.

# Nothing yet. Might be worthwhile to create a build without the web
# server in the future.

# In addition to node we really need the 'forever' npm package as well, but
# cannot easily test for this as a dependency (AFAIK).
